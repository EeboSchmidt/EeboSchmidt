- 👋 Hi, I’m @EeboSchmidt
- 👀 I’m interested in creating the best kind of work I can, using every tool at my disposal. Oh, and I am also interested in cybersecurity. 
- 🌱 I’m currently learning automation with Python, and PHP (along with all the other things that go with that)
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on interesting and potentially revolutionary programs, especially one program to rule them all!
- 📫 How to reach me? Contact me on Github or my email account: ebenkleinaub@gmail.com
- 😄 Pronouns: Mr. I think.
- ⚡ Fun fact: I like to joke and make others smile, especially myself. Also, I like to watch the Moon Man.
